TODO: Guide on how to develop native wayland app for different webOS versions.
It should include the following:

* How to link against `libwayland-client`, etc. in webOS
* How to deal with broken ABI
* How to deal with webOS specific behaviors (multiple seats, etc.)
* Code references ([SDL-webOS](https://github.com/webosbrew/SDL-webOS))
